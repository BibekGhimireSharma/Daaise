# 🕸️ Shortest Path Problem with Obstacles – Modified Dijkstra Algorithm

A project implementing a **Modified Dijkstra's Algorithm** to solve the shortest path problem in graphs that include **obstacles** (like restricted nodes or broken edges). This version intelligently avoids blocked paths while computing the shortest distance.

---

## ❓ Why I Built This

I created this project to:

- Understand and implement graph algorithms in real-life scenarios
- Solve more **complex pathfinding problems** where basic Dijkstra fails
- Explore how obstacles affect graph traversal and optimization
- Share insights through a blog to help others learn

---

## 🧠 What It Does

- Finds the **shortest path** from a source to a destination
- Avoids nodes/edges marked as **obstacles**
- Supports **custom inputs** and graph configurations
- Can be adapted for **game maps**, **routing systems**, and **AI agents**

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Uses a **priority queue (min-heap)** for efficient shortest path calculation
- Modifies Dijkstra's logic to **skip blocked nodes/edges**
- Graph is represented using an **adjacency list** or **matrix**
- Handles **dynamic obstacles** (can be added/removed)

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- 💻 Programming Language: Java
- 🧮 Data Structures: Graph, Priority Queue, Set
- 📜 Input: Static or from file/console
